# Maths_teaching
Collection of programmes for a secondary school challenge project at Exeter Maths College on fractals. Much of the programming challenge part of this centers around using classes to recursively generate additional iterations of a fractal.
Koch_2.pdf contains a layout of the problem.
Julia_Gen.py is a generator of a false colour map of a julia fractal.
Cantor_Plot.py is a generator for a cantor set.
Koch.py creates the standard Koch snowflake up to Max_iterations=7 in the file.
Koch_M_Flake.py creates the M_N flake (as defined in Koch_2.pdf) up to M_Fmax=7 (number of sided shape to iterate) and N=5 (max iterations)
